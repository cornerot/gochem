{"name":"goChem","tagline":"A library for computational chemistry.","body":"![chemistry gopher](https://raw.github.com/rmera/gochem/master/images/gopherweb.png) \r\n\r\ngoChem is an open-source library for simplifying the common tasks of a computational chemist at a classical and quantum level. Although it is somewhat bio-oriented, it aims to be useful for chemistry in general.\r\n\r\ngoChem provides a nice set of [features](features-link) including geometric analysis, compatibility with several structre and trajectory formats, and interaction with several quantum-chemistry packages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, goChem provides a simple way for applications to be turned into [PyMOL](http://www.pymol.org) plugins. In this way, goChem applications can easily have a graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nThe library aims at ease of usage, simplicity and maintainability. Performance is not sacrified, and making proper use of multi-core machines is also a goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
