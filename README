Gochem is a libary for chemistry, especially computational biochemistry, in go.
It provides structures for handling atoms and molecules, reading/writing some common formats 
(currently xyz and PDB) and a few functions for geometrical manipulation of molecules.

In gochem the Atom container contains all information about an atom that is not expected to vary
between states (mas, etc). Coordinates and b-factors are stored separately as Nx3 gomatrix dense
matrices the firsts and as slices of N float64 the seconds (N being the number of atoms).

A Molecule container, then, contains a slice of Atoms, a slice of gomatrix dense matrices (one 
for each state of the molecule) for the coordinates, and a slice of slices of float64 for the 
b-factors.

The Molecule structure implements the sort.Interface interface, in such a way that the atoms, 
coordinates and b-factors, together, can be sorted with one function call. They are sorted 
according to the b-factors of the first state of the molecule.


Design goals:

*Simplicity (of the code).
*Readability.
*Assume that users can code (dont overcomplicate the code with zillion simplifying functions)
*Try to avoid the need for users to know gomatrix as much as possible
	-Supply convenience functions to deal with coordinates.
	-Of course users wanting to code calculations will need gomatrix anyway.
*Fast and light
*Easy to extend
*Useful for computational biochemistry at a classic and QM levels.




Currently Does:

Reads/writes PDB
Reads/writes XYZ files
Superimpose molecules (adequate for small molecules since doesn't use sequence information).
Calculate RMSD between molecules.
Allows to get atoms and coordinates from a list, or manually.
Allows to replace coordinates.
Calculates moment tensor and elipsoid of inertia--related properties (not tested).
Implements the sort.Interface interface, it can be sorted by b-factors.

Sort of does:
Reads xtc files Does not work on all machines (apparently only 64 bits). Also, it is not included in the
default package since requires the xdrfile package to be installed. It can also be fount on my github, and it must be put manually
in the directory of the rest of the package.



TODOS:


*Protein superimposer (Calign).
*Read/Write Mopac2009 input/output files for quick optimizations.
*Same for ORCA  (b-factors of 1 could mean fixed atoms).
*Additional geometrical manipulation tools.
