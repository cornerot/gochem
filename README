Design goals:

*Stick to KISS principle as much as possible
	-This means, code simplicity comes before user  friendliness
*Related to the previous: Readability counts.
*Assume that users can code (dont provide too many simplifying functions)
*Try to avoid the need for users to know gomatrix as much as possible
	-Supply convenience functions to deal with coordinates.
	-Of course users wanting to code calculations will need gomatrix anyway.
*Fast and light
*Easy to extend
*Useful for computational biochemistry at a classic and QM levels.




Currently Does:

Reads/writes PDB
Reads/writes XYZ files
Superimpose files (adequate for small molecules since doesn't use sequence information)
Reads xtc files (working in some computers?)
Allows to get atoms and coordinates from a list, or manually
Allows to replace coordinates
Calculates moment of inertia and elipsoid of inertia--related properties
Implements the sort.Interface interface, it can be sorted by b-factors.


TODOS:

Before version 0.1:

*Add atoms at the end
*Separate the thing in different files (MUST)
*Test geometical things (MUST)


OTHER TODOS:
*Protein superimposer (Calign).
*Read/Write Mopac2009 input/output files for quick optimizations.
*Same for ORCA. (b-factors of 1 could mean fixed atoms)
