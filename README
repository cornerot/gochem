Gochem is a library for chemistry, especially computational biochemistry, in go.
It provides structures for handling atoms and molecules, reading/writing some common formats 
(currently xyz, PDB and xtc) and a few functions for geometrical manipulation of molecules.

In gochem the Atom container contains all information about an atom that is not expected to vary
between states (mass, etc). Coordinates and b-factors (or temperature factors) are stored 
separately as Nx3 gomatrix dense matrices the firsts and as slices of N float64 the seconds 
(N being the number of atoms).

A Molecule container, then, contains a slice of Atoms, a slice of gomatrix dense matrices (one 
matrix for each state of the molecule) for the coordinates, and a slice of slices of float64 
for the b-factors.

The Molecule structure implements the sort.Interface interface, so that the atoms, 
coordinates and b-factors, together, can be sorted with one function call. They are sorted 
according to the b-factors of the first state of the molecule.

The library allows to read Gromacs trajectory files (xtc) if the flag 'gromacs' is given during the build.
This requires the xdrfile from the Gromacs team (www.gromacs.org).


Design goals:

*Simplicity (of the code).
*Readability.
*Assume that users can code (dont overcomplicate the code with zillion simplifying functions)
*Try to avoid the need for users to know gomatrix as much as possible
	-Supply convenience functions to deal with coordinates.
	-Of course users wanting to code calculations will need gomatrix anyway.
*Fast and light
*Easy to extend
*Useful for computational biochemistry at a classical and QM levels.




Currently Does:

Reads/writes PDB
Reads/writes XYZ files
Superimpose molecules (adequate for small molecules since doesn't use sequence information).
  -The user can specify what atoms to use for the supeimpose transformation calculation. 
   Then all the atoms will be supperimposed according to that transformation (i.e. the mole
   cules to superimpose don't need to be identical)
Calculate RMSD between molecules.
Allows to get atoms and coordinates from a list, or manually.
Allows to replace coordinates.
Calculates moment tensor and elipsoid of inertia--related properties (not tested).
The Molecule objeccts implements the sort.Interface interface, so atoms 
can be sorted by b-factors.
Axis manipulation:
	Align a vector with the Z axis
	Rotate around the Z axis until the xy proj. of a vector becomes the Y axis
Simple geometrical calculations
Reads XTC files (see above)


TODOS:


*Protein superimposer (Calign?).
*Read/Write Mopac2009 input/output files for quick optimizations.
*Same for ORCA  (b-factors of >=1 could mean fixed atoms).
*Additional geometrical manipulation tools.


Currently, gochem is licensed under LGPL2. This might change towards BSD in the future. Meanwhile, if you want to use 
some of this for a BSD-licensed project, let me know.
